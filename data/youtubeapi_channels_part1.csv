UCY2qt3dw2TQJxvBrDiYGHdQ,Pink Floyd,"Pink Floyd, one of the most successful and influential groups ever, formed in the 1960s when Roger Waters, Nick Mason and Richard Wright were studying at college in London. They added Roger ‚ÄòSyd‚Äô Barrett, a Cambridge friend, who named the band after bluesmen Pink Anderson and Floyd Council.
 
Debut album The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn is still considered one of the greatest psychedelic albums, but in 1968 Syd Barrett‚Äôs erratic behaviour prompted his replacement by David Gilmour, another friend. Pink Floyd developed the members‚Äô compositional and improvisational talents, and built a large audience via many live tours, releasing a succession of hit albums, including The Dark Side Of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, and The Wall.
 
Roger Waters left in 1985, but the band enjoyed continuing success with the studio albums A Momentary Lapse Of Reason and The Division Bell, accompanied by world tours. The final Pink Floyd release was 2014‚Äôs The Endless River, another worldwide #1 album.",1971037339,3860000,735,0

UCQxsahIsaO7_nDwVlFRMQiA,Ludovico Einaudi,"Fresh from this year's triumph of the Nomadland and The Father soundtracks, illustrious composer and pianist Ludovico Einaudi announces Underwater, his first new solo piano album in 20 years. Underwater was born in lockdown, utilising the rare opportunity for song-writing in its purest and most intimate form: just Einaudi and his piano. It features 12 newly-composed solo piano tracks, beautifully showcasing his unmistakable musical style which is renowned around the world.

On the making of Underwater during the pandemic, Einaudi explains: ""It came naturally, more than ever before. I felt a sense of freedom to abandon myself and let the music flow differently. I didn‚Äôt have a filter between me and what came out of the piano; it felt very pure. The title Underwater is a metaphor ‚Äì it is an expression of a very fluid dimension, without interference from outside.""

On leaving college she was asked by Producer Nicky Ryan to join her siblings in their family band. She did so for a short time, but found it too restrictive musically, and so in 1982 she joined Nicky Ryan and Roma Ryan in a creative and business partnership. Enya's first commission was to write a score for Sir David Puttnam for his film ""The Frog Prince"". Then, the triumvirate secured the soundtrack to the BBC documentary series 'The Celts'. Enya was then signed by Warner Music and all three by EMI Music Publishing. The first album of this contract was ""Watermark"" with the hit single ""Orinoco Flow"". This was followed by ""Shepherd Moons"", ""The Memory of Trees"", ""Paint the Sky With Stars"", ""A Day Without Rain"" which produced the single, ""Only Time"". Enya also released ""Amarantine"" and for Lord of the Rings; the Fellowship of the Ring, the songs ""Aniron"" and ""May it Be"". Enya, Nicky and Roma were nominated for a Golden Globe Award and for an Academy Award for the song ""May it Be"" and have also merited many other nominations and awards, including the Ivor Novello for International Achievement. The latest honours bestowed on Enya were two Honorary Degrees, the University of Galway honoured her with Doctor of Music and the University of Ulster honoured Enya with Doctor of Letters.",216753907,30500,417,0

UCOkWMIcLDDV1P48NSCdkJ5w,Asthmatic Kitty Records,"Born in 1999, Asthmatic Kitty Records was originally conceived as a platform for musical projects by a community of artists from Holland, Michigan, a small city on the shore of Lake Michigan. Some were Holland natives, and others had come to attend local colleges and universities. While the original Holland nucleus has now dispersed to various parts of the country, the fellowship is still growing, with new friends and shared projects with other independent labels. Asthmatic Kitty is now based in Lander, Wyoming, Indianapolis, Indiana and New York City.

Asthmatic Kitty was named after Sara, a voluptuous orange and white longhair who wandered out of the woods in 1995, pregnant, starving, and afflicted with various parasites and ailments, including feline asthma. Although she still wheezes a bit, especially when being chased by her sister Tabby, Sara today enjoys a healthy and happy life of luxury. Cast-off animals make the best pets!",100148948,90300,348,0

He runs and leads his charity ‚ÄúDaddy‚Äôs House,‚Äù which Billboard commended with the Spirit of Hope Award. After changing the face of Latin music forever, he leaves on the highest note possible in 2022 with his final album, LEGENDADDY, brought to life with his farewell tour, LA √öLTIMA VUELTA who has sold nearly two million tickets and grossed more than $200 million, making it the 2nd highest-grossing tour of 2023‚Äôs first quarter, according to Pollstar box office.

Along with punk rock, the Clash also have played music genres such as post-punk, experimental rock, and new wave and their music often also incorporated elements of reggae, dub, funk, ska and rockabilly. For most of their recording career the Clash consisted of Joe Strummer (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Mick Jones (lead guitar, lead vocals), Paul Simonon (bass guitar, vocals) and Nicky ""Topper"" Headon (drums, percussion). Headon left the group in 1982, and internal friction led to Jones' departure the following year. The group continued with new members, but finally disbanded in early 1986.",423534546,176000,156,0

Jose Feliciano feat. FaWiJo

Biografie

The fabulous career of Fabian, called ‚ÄúFaWiJo‚Äù began three years ago when he recorded together with Jos√© Feliciano the Christmas hit ‚ÄúFeliz Navidad‚Äù which immediately hit the Christmas music market and has already more than 50 Million views on YouTube. 
‚ÄúFabian celebrates ‚ÄúFeliz Navidad‚Äù
Nancy Hahn, founder of iRead2Know iHeartRadio, contacted him after she saw his outstanding talent. FaWiJo started to record his first album immediately after, inspired by certain songs from Nancy Hahn. The album ""Yes we can"" has been released in September 2018 and includes lots of guest artists as Jos√© Feliciano, Jelena (the golden voice of Serbia) as well as the title song of iRead2Know iHeartRadio ‚ÄúiRead2Know‚Äù. 
Since then FaWiJo receives lots of performance request and invitations, f.ex. an invitation from the pope to sing at the Vatican in December 2018.
This year 2022 FaWiJo has released his 2nd Album ""Eleven"" :-)

Announcing their arrival with debut album Leisure in 1991, Blur continued to revolutionise the sound of English popular music with second release Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993). Five successive UK #1 albums followed - with Parklife (1994) and The Great Escape (1995) helping to propel the band to mass popularity in the UK and beyond. The eponymous Blur was released in 1997 and seventh album Think Tank (2003) was Blur‚Äôs first as a three-piece after the temporary departure of founding guitarist Graham Coxon. Twenty one years after the release of their debut album, 2012 saw Blur 21: The Box, the band's body of work compiled and gathered together into one box. Their most recent release as a four-piece, the critically acclaimed chart-topping album The Magic Whip (2015), started life in Hong Kong when the band had an unexpected break in touring in May 2013.

Fue iniciado en la ciudad de Bogot√° por Jairo Varela Mart√≠nez, oriundo del departamento de Choc√≥. Con el paso del tiempo y en busca de inspiraci√≥n, decidieron viajar a la ciudad de Buenaventura en la costa del Pac√≠fico colombiano, y finalmente, en 1983, se instalaron en Cali, en la regi√≥n occidental del pa√≠s, que se convertir√≠a en su base de operaciones.

En 1990, Jairo Varela produjo ¬´Cielo de Tambores¬ª, el √°lbum de mayor √©xito del grupo. Canciones como ¬´Una Aventura¬ª, ¬´Busca por Dentro¬ª, ¬´Se pareci√≥ tanto a ti¬ª, ¬´Sin Sentimiento¬ª, ¬´Cali Aj√≠¬ª y ¬´Debiera Olvidarla¬ª abrieron nuevos caminos y fueron un √©xito innegable en toda Am√©rica Latina. Con sus recorridos, el grupo utiliz√≥ su nueva influencia para entretener a sus compatriotas inmigrantes y a los grupos √©tnicos de cada pa√≠s.

El 8 de agosto de 2012, el maestro Jairo Varela sufri√≥ otro infarto que le provoc√≥ la muerte. Hubo una gran aflicci√≥n por su fallecimiento en Colombia y varios otros pa√≠ses. Su funeral dur√≥ cuatro d√≠as debido a la ovaci√≥n de sus fans. Se recibieron numerosos homenajes de gobiernos y personas, y comenz√≥ la leyenda de ¬´Jairo¬ª.

UCdq_lj5ITbz67U4s52kaRPw,Olivia Newton-John - Topic,"Olivia Newton-John, born in Cambridge, England, was raised in Melbourne, Australia, where her father was a headmaster of Ormond College. She entered show business at the age of 12 and later won a television talent contest, which took her to London, England. In London, she formed a duo and recorded her first single, a version of Bob Dylan's ""'Til You Say You'll Be Mine."" Newton-John became part of Cliff Richard's touring show and made her breakthrough with the single ""If Not for You."" For the next two years, she had success in Britain but failed to make an impact in the US. She then moved to Los Angeles in 1974 and recorded the hit song ""Let Me Be There,"" which won the Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance, Female. Olivia's transformation from a country singer to a pop singer was complete in 1978 when she starred in the movie version of the popular Broadway musical Grease. The movie was a hit and produced three huge hit singles, including ""You're the One That I Want."" Olivia Newton-John skillfully made the transition to popular mainstream soft rock singer and became one of the most successful vocalists of the '70s and '80s. Her sweet voice suited both country-pop and soft rock perfectly, which kept her at the top of the charts until the mid-'80s. Olivia Newton-John's '70s and '80s hits remained soft rock and adult contemporary staples into the '90s and 2000s.",99752725,12300,941,0

With their 1970 chart breakthroughs of ""(They Long To Be) Close to You"" and ""We've Only Just Begun,"" Richard and Karen Carpenter set a new standard for melodic pop that has never been surpassed. With over 100 million in sales, the Carpenters are among the all-time most successful artists in recording history. The long hit list also includes ""Rainy Days And Mondays,"" ""Top of the World,"" ""Yesterday Once More"" and ""Superstar.""  On the heels of RPO successes with Elvis Presley, Aretha Franklin, Roy Orbison and The Beach Boys, Carpenters With The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra marks the first time the series has the actual artist playing key roles in the recording process. Richard Carpenter served as the album's producer, arranger and conductor.  ""I think that's what makes it very special: the fact that it's his music and he knows it and that he was there from the start,"" says Royal Philharmonic orchestral manager Ian Maclay. ""It's not somebody else interpreting, which is what normally happens.""  The fusion of Richard's production genius, the duo's harmonies and Karen's immortal vocals make Carpenters both endearing and enduring.",216640455,14900,1183,0

Naci√≥ el 17 de Mayo de 1919 en Villanueva  Zacatecas, M√©xico, y fue bautizado con el nombre de  Pascual Antonio Aguilar Barraza. A principios de los a√±os 40, fue a los Estados Unidos para estudiar canto. En 1950 debut√≥ en la radio XEW, lo que impuls√≥ en gran medida su carrera. Fue a principios de esa d√©cada que comenz√≥ a grabar sus primeros temas en Discos Musart, compa√±√≠a que fue su disquera de toda la vida.

Antonio Aguilar es reconocido como el artista que abri√≥ las puertas de los Estados Unidos y otros pa√≠ses para much√≠simos otros mexicanos y latinos que vinieron despu√©s de √©l. Por algo es conocido con toda justicia como ‚ÄúEl Charro de M√©xico‚Äù.

Est. 1991 - South Gate, CA

Three decades ago, B-Real, Sen Dog, and DJ Muggs sparked a trip that left popular culture stoned, stunned, and staggering in anticipation for more. Naming themselves after a local street in Los Angeles, Cypress Hill burst on the scene in '91 with the release of their self-titled debut album. Singles ‚ÄúHow I Could Just Kill a Man‚Äù & ‚ÄúThe Phuncky Feel One‚Äù became underground hits and the group‚Äôs pro-marijuana stance earned them many fans among the alt rock community. Cypress Hill followed their debut with Black Sunday in the summer of '93, which debuted at #1 on Billboard‚Äôs Top 200, garnered three GRAMMY¬Æ Award nominations, and went 3X Platinum in the U.S. As a result, Cypress Hill became the first rap group to have two albums in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 charts at the same time and are the first Latino-American hip-hop group to achieve platinum and multi-platinum success.

Counting Crows hail from the San Francisco Bay Area and consist of Adam Duritz (vocals), David Bryson (guitar), Charles Gillingham (keyboards), Dan Vickrey (guitar), Jim Bogios (drums), and Millard Powers (bass). Counting Crows success dates back to their 1993 debut release August and Everything After and the hit single ‚ÄúMr. Jones.‚Äù The band hit #1 with the song ‚ÄúAccidentally In Love,‚Äù which was featured on the Shrek 2 soundtrack, as well as nominations in 2005 for a Grammy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and an Academy Award for the track.

UC7d6hou24HcG5sA2lwTgV0A,Duran Duran - Topic,"How many bands can you think of that, decades into their career, are still capable of springing surprises, of blazing fresh trails, creating new music that is up there with the imperishable songs that first propelled them to fame, fortune and critical acclaim? It‚Äôs an interesting exercise, and a brief one ‚Äì a list you can make on the fingers of one hand. In 2015, Duran Duran will cement their place in that illustrious grouping with a new studio album ‚Äì their 14th, no less ‚Äì that burnishes their role in the story of pop, and puts the many young pretenders whose music they have influenced firmly in their place. As part of a major new recording deal with Warner Bros. Records, Paper Gods starts the next chapter in the history of the band, with a host of A-list collaborators ‚Äì including Nile Rodgers, Mark Ronson, Mr Hudson, Janelle Mon√°e, John Frusciante, Kiesza and Davide Rossi ‚Äì joining the party. ‚ÄúWe found a whole new level of inspiration on this album,‚Äù says the band‚Äôs keyboardist and aesthetic overlord, Nick Rhodes. ‚ÄúWe were talking the 
other day about artists that have been around for a long time ‚Äì our contemporaries and some older ones, and there‚Äôs only a handful of the latter now, still out there playing shows. And we were saying, ‚ÄòWhat albums did they make this far down the line that we own?‚Äô And that was a difficult one.‚Äù

Simon Le Bon has a theory as to why the band are still friends, and still making vital, compelling music, 37 years after Duran Duran first formed in Birmingham. ‚ÄúI think with some artists, as they get into extended careers, it‚Äôs like climbing up a rock-face ‚Äì they start to look down. If you do that, musically, you‚Äôre pretty much dead in the water. You can hear it when someone‚Äôs thought about it just a little too much, or tried to write something that they think people will like, rather than something that turns them on. We‚Äôve always written music that turns us on; we‚Äôve never tried to tailor it to any kind of taste.‚Äù Band politics play a role, too, he says. ‚ÄúI think part of our strength is the tension in our music, which probably comes from the tension within the band. When you‚Äôre young, you‚Äôre not scared of upsetting people, and actually we can still push that sometimes. But harsh words are forgiven. Ultimately, we know that we will fight for each other, whatever the situation. We stick together. Nick and I can fight tooth and nail, over a lyric, or a musical part. And you would think in those moments that we hate each other‚Äôs gut",234460928,10600,1754,0

The band originated in America as The Scam in 1995 but changed the name to Godsmack after its first demo. Their first CD, All Wound Up, was recorded in 1996. By 1998, the CD had gained the attention of a local radio station and began to sell in a record store chain. In mid-1998, Godsmack was signed to Universal/Republic Records. They released a self-titled album that was certified 4x platinum. A headlining tour followed along with performances at Ozzfest and a European tour supporting Black Sabbath. Their second album, Awake, was certified 2x platinum in 2000 after having mostly been created on the road. Much of the early years were spent touring. Godsmack embarked on another European tour, this time supporting Limp Bizkit. Their popularity grew steadily, and their first album to debut at #1 was their third album, Faceless, in 2003. ‚ÄúStraight Out of Line‚Äù, the Faceless lead single, also received a Grammy award nomination. It was nominated for ‚ÄúBest Hard Rock Performance‚Äù. An acoustic EP was released in 2004. Another chart-topping album, IV, and a tour followed in 2006 and 2007. Their fifth studio album, The Oracle, was released in 2010 and became their third album to debut at #1 on Billboard Hot 100. After a break throughout the year of 2013, 1000hp was released to popular reception in 2014, hitting #5 on the charts. Godsmack has participated in a number of music festivals and tours, supporting bands like Motley Crue and performing alongside Staind and Disturbed.

Considerada una de las agrupaciones m√°s importantes del rock nacional, los Redonditos de Ricota tienen su origen en La Plata, en el a√±o 1976. Descendientes directos de La Cofrad√≠a de la Flor Solar, la banda tuvo tres pilares inamovibles desde su inicio: el ‚ÄúIndio‚Äù Solari, ‚ÄúSkay‚Äù Beilinson y Carmen Castro ‚ÄúLa Negra Poli‚Äù, todos ellos asesorados art√≠sticamente por Ricardo Cohen, alias ‚ÄúRocambole‚Äù.

Promotores del ‚Äúboca en boca‚Äù, recorrieron el circuito under de los pubs y teatros hasta que, promediando los ‚Äò80 y con dos discos en su haber alcanzaron la popularidad y afianzaron la identidad ricotera plantando himnos que fueron y ser√°n emblemas del rock argentino.

Con once discos oficiales y decenas de conciertos a lleno total, Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota dej√≥ de existir como tal en noviembre de 2001 dando inicio a la carrera solista de cada uno de sus integrantes.",395841980,347000,128,0

I post various videos! They are most usually music related, but they vary. Most of the time, I upload videos of my piano covers, although I haven't had a lot of free time recently... ^-^

I usually play by ear, which means that some of the songs I play are ""my versions"", and not exactly as the originals are. But I hope you take this as a... creative way of interpreting music and not as a ""wrong"" one...! =P

Hope you like this channel! Please subscribe to me or ""box"" me if you do like it! I can't wait to ""enrich"" it a bit when I get more time... I plan to post videos of guitar and vocal covers as well ...in the future! =P",2039814,1770,19,0

I'd like to thank the copyright owners for allowing this channel to stay up, including Universal Music Group, A&M Records, and all others.  I don't own the copyrights to any of this material, and the true copyright owners are gracious in allowing Sheryl's fans to have access to her music here.

And please, no foul language.  It drags down the entire discussion.  There's plenty of places on-line to go swear and fight -- but not here.  I'll delete your posts and block you if need be.  Critical comments about Sheryl are always accepted as long as it's not plain old hating, trolling, or foul language. Anyway, enough about this...

""Can I use your edit in a video?""
Sure, credit is appreciated but not required.

""Can you upload 4 Morant on Spotify?""
I believe there is already an upload for it on there. I do not own this song, I can not and will not cross-post it anywhere else.

""How often do you upload?""
I am not active at all lol I upload when I find something I really want to share. This is something I do purely for fun, and I do not check this channel very often, sorry.

A la edad de 22 a√±os, mientras era maestro de m√∫sica en la secundaria del poblado de Villa Uni√≥n, se inicia de manera profesional como vocalista y bajista al formar parte del grupo vers√°til Karisma. Al mismo tiempo, integra el coro de la iglesia del pueblo.

Su talento y don para componer, lo llevan a√±os m√°s tarde a formar parte de Banda Los Recoditos, donde se convierte en su voz principal logrando destacar con sus propias canciones. Adem√°s, fue el creador del estilo rom√°ntico en la m√∫sica de banda y es as√≠ que Recoditos empieza a sonar en las radios del Pac√≠fico gracias a los temas de Pancho Barraza.

Es tanta su inquietud por crear y la confianza que se tiene como cantante, compositor y m√∫sico que en 1995 se separa de Los Recoditos para lanzarse como solista y forma su propia banda a la cual bautiz√≥ con el nombre de ‚ÄúSanta Mar√≠a‚Äù.",346352086,9560,1122,0

We've got music from every single studio album and a bevy of live albums, to boot. There are celebrated live performances from the 70s and 80s and official videos with more skeletons than you can shake your bones at, an exclusive seaside series on what's to come from the band's rich catalog and details on meet-ups all across the promised land. If it's community you‚Äôre after, try your hand at our yearly DEAD COVERS PROJECT competition and connect with fellow Dead Heads around the world. Heck, keep your eyes peeled you might even catch a glimpse of Pigpen on keys, Jerry in a GROOVE, Bobby tellin' tales, Mickey talkin' space, Phil and friends, Bill on the beach, or anyone from our extended family.

In Your Dreams was written and recorded at Nicks' Los Angeles home and is co-produced by Dave Stewart and Glen Ballard. Nicks and Stewart co-wrote seven of the album's thirteen songs. ""I had written a song in Brisbane, Australia when I was on tour with Fleetwood Mac in 2009 called 'Moonlight - A Vampire's Dream' which was inspired by the New Moon film. When I finished writing that song, which came together really quickly, I knew the time was right to start recording. We had a core group of five people who were at the heart of the creation of In Your Dreams. Dave and myself, my longtime friend and musical director, Waddy Wachtel, and my girls, Sharon Celani and Lori Nicks. It was a perfect blend,"""" commented Nicks. ""This was one of the most extraordinary experiences I've had making a record. It is the first album that I have had this kind of collaboration since the making of Rumours. Dave created a situation where I could be totally creative and focused on writing songs and making music. I cannot remember ever having this much fun making a record. Writing the songs and recording them in my home studio was the key element in how this music turned out. It made the whole process seem very similar to how we used to work back in the day,"" she concluded.

The first single is ""Secret Love"" written by Nicks. ""It was 1976 and Fleetwood Mac was opening for Peter Frampton at the time. It was written about a forbidden relationship - not Peter and I,"" laughed Nicks. ""I always knew that one day I was going to record the song.""",125362408,9420,951,0

More than 100 gold and platinum records from all over the world. On top they scored more top ten hits in the charts than any other German band and can call on a catalogue of top ten tracks to rival those of the most successful artists of all time, names like Madonna, Michael Jackson, Rihanna or Depeche Mode - earning them the accolade of Germany's most successful chart act since records began.

La GIRAS de la movida tropical, esas noches sin descanso en las que los artistas llegan, arman, cantan, desarman, se meten en la combi y al pr√≥ximo baile, son el sello de este g√©nero que nos trae diversi√≥n, recuerdos y fanatismos incre√≠bles.
Ahora todos coreamos  LA CUMBIA ME DIVIERTE Y MESITA o NO ME ARREPIENTO DE ESTE AMOR o como la Selecci√≥n que pidi√≥ LA CUMBIA DE LOS TRAPOS en la otra punta del planeta, donde nos consagramos. Pero no siempre fue as√≠, hasta hace poco a la cumbia y al cumbiero nos miraban de costado.
En la tele y las radios grandes, muchas veces la m√∫sica popular no entraba, no ""vend√≠a"", era muy de pueblo...estaba sin decirlo como PROHIBIDA.
Hoy traemos a los √≠conos de nuestro pa√≠s, los que hacen miles de kil√≥metros por nuestras rutas, y llevan alegr√≠a y fiesta.
Bailemos y vibremos al ritmo de las que ya nos sabemos todos y que
                                                                                 NUNCA NOS FALTE LA CUMBIA.

The band started out in a village in southern France, during the '70s when brothers Nicolas and Andre Reyes, teamed up with their cousins Jacques, Maurice, and Tonino Baliardo. They started out as a Gypsy band playing weddings, festivals, and in the streets. This led to the band adopting the name the Gipsy Kings. Their debut album spent 40 weeks on the U.S. charts, going gold. The Kings have had an active release schedule since, including the albums Mosaique (1989), Live! (1992), Love & Liberte (1994), Tierra Gitana (1996), Cantos de Amor (1998), Somos Gitanos (2001), and Roots (2004). After extended touring, a new studio album Pasajero appeared in 2007, followed later that year by Live in Los Angeles. The Gipsy Kings continued touring the globe almost incessantly before taking an extended break during which several greatest-hits and best-of compilations appeared.",422510796,296000,81,0

UCk1itjM0NGtzu0hHxcPdB4A,Todd Terry - Topic,"Grammy Award nominated DJ/Producer Todd Terry has been engulfed in dance music since he first started listening to European dance music records while growing up in Brooklyn. Already devoted to turntables, he heard something different in those tracks, and he ‚Äúwent for the difference. I never got a break in New York, but England happened right away, so I catered to them.‚Äù In any event, the Todd Terry sound was born.

By 1988, Todd Terry hit big in England and Europe, and his notoriety was making its way back to the U.S. In addition to DJ appearances, Todd was cutting his classic underground tracks A Day In The Life, Weekend, and Can You Party, released under monikers such as the Todd Terry Project, House Of Gypsies, and Royal House, all considered essential and ground breaking.

In the mid 90‚Äôs, the Ministry of Sound‚Äôs eponymous UK label released A Day In The Life, a collection of Todd Terry tracks that had been causing dance floor panic. That then led the way to a deal with Mercury Records allowing him to set up a context in which to work with his favourite singers and performers. The first release, Keep On Jumpin‚Äô on featured a vocal workout from super-divas Martha Wash and Jocelyn Brown, together for the first time ever. The song became a top 10 UK crossover pop hit and worldwide smash. Todd followed with the anthem ‚ÄòSomethin Going On‚Äô, a top 5 UK crossover pop hit.

All the while, Todd continued to break new ground as a Producer/Remixer. From SNAP to Annie Lennox to George Michael to Bjork, Todd‚Äôs mixes bridge the ground between club cool and commercial accessibility. In 1995, his remix for Everything But The Girl‚Äôs Missing became a worldwide smash, giving the British duo their first ever hit. He then rode the charts with mixes for Garbage (Stupid Girl), The Cardigans (Love Fool), Everything But The Girl (Wrong), 10,000 Maniacs (More Than This), Jamiroquai (Alright), The Cardigans (Been It), and The Lightning Seeds (You Showed Me),.among others. He also produced a Robin S track (Givin‚Äô You All That I‚Äôve Got) for the multi-platinum Space Jam soundtrack.

Todd is one of the world‚Äôs most celebrated figures in dance music. With almost two decades of dance floor domination under Todd‚Äôs belt the quality of his productions goes from strength to strength. Welcome to the church of house music presided over by Todd the God. Are you a believer?",4626192,1470,2473,0

Fue un cantante que supo interpretar la cumbia con estilo colombiano. A los 20 a√±os se incorpora como cantante en el Grupo Trinidad, alcanzando fama y reconocimiento. Su inconfundible estilo llev√≥ a Trinidad al pico m√°s alto de su historia. Leo es reconocido por el p√∫blico como uno de los m√°s rom√°nticos. En la madrugada del 15 de Enero de 2000, mientras regresaban de una gira en el norte santafesino, pierden la vida Sergio Reyes y Dar√≠o Bevegni. Tambi√©n sufre heridas el conductor y Leo queda en estado cr√≠tico, casi al borde de la muerte. Tuvo que ser intervenido quir√∫rgicamente y su recuperaci√≥n llev√≥ m√°s de tres meses. Durante ese per√≠odo Leo mostr√≥ su templanza y sus ganas de vivir. 
Unos meses antes, en noviembre de 1999, con renovados proyectos y ambiciones, decide enfrentar el desaf√≠o de conquistar nuevos horizontes e ir en busca del √©xito personal iniciando su carrera como solista. 
Su primer √°lbum, que lleva por nombre ""Un homenaje al cielo"" (2000). Es as√≠ que comienza su carrera en solitario con la misma gran repercusi√≥n y contin√∫a presentando su material con shows que abarcan todo el pa√≠s atrapando la atenci√≥n de todo tipo de p√∫blico que van desde los adolescentes hasta la gente mayor. 
Leo Mattioli falleci√≥ el 7 de agosto de 2011 en Necochea a los 38 a√±os de edad, a causa de la insuficiencia card√≠aca que lo aquejaba desde hac√≠a a√±os.",436142793,11100,674,0

Death Cab for Cutie is an American alternative rock band formed in Bellingham, Washington in 1997. The band is composed of Ben Gibbard, Nick Harmer, Jason McGerr, Dave Depper, and Zac Rae. Death Cab for Cutie rose from being a side project to becoming one of the most exciting groups to emerge from the indie rock scene of the ‚Äô00s. They have been nominated for eight Grammy Awards. The band‚Äôs tenth studio album ‚ÄòAsphalt Meadows‚Äô is out now.

‚ÄúFor a band in its third decade‚Ä¶ Death Cab hasn‚Äôt lost its gift for pairing Gibbard‚Äôs soft ruminations with propulsive arrangements that know just when to sparkle and sway. But even more importantly, Gibbard himself still sings with a sense of purpose, keenly articulating a distinct swirl of nostalgia, loss and hope for new beginnings.‚Äù ‚ÄîNPR Music

In 1980 he founded WOMAD (World of Music Arts and Dance), which has presented 170 festivals in over 30 countries. The festival became the inspiration for Real World Records, which he launched in 1989 with the aim of providing talented artists from around the world with access to state-of-the-art recording facilities, and help get their music better known around the world. Artists released by the label such as Hukwe Zawose, Ayub Ogada, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Papa Wemba, Tot√≥ La Momposina, Sheila Chandra and more recently The Gloaming and Loney dear,  have all helped establish the label‚Äôs eclectic credentials. 

Since 1980, when Peter released the anti-apartheid single ‚ÄòBiko‚Äô he has been actively involved in human rights campaigning. He has participated in many benefit concerts, notably Amnesty International‚Äôs 1988 Human Rights Now! Tour, which was the first benefit concert to tour globally with Youssou N‚ÄôDour, Bruce Springsteen, Tracy Chapman and Sting. It was on this tour he saw first hand how video can transform a human rights activist‚Äôs chances of achieving justice and change, and in 1992 proposed the creation of an organization to pioneer the use of video in human rights work, Witness.org. Around 2000 he co-founded the Elders.og, with Richard Branson, to bring together a small group of highly respected global leaders, launched with Nelson Mandela in July 2007.   

In 1999 Peter co-founded On Demand Distribution (OD2) with Charles Grimsdale and others, which quickly became Europe‚Äôs first successful Digital Music Download retailer (and pre-dated Apple‚Äôs iTunes launch in Europe by some four years).  OD2 is now Nokia Music. 

Still convinced in the need for easy digital access to music, he co-founded WE7, a streaming service, with John Taysom and Steve Purdham in 2006 (two years before Spotify). It was sold in 2013. 

In 2008 Peter, along with Real World and British Hifi manufacturer Bowers and Wilkins, created the Society of Sound to record and release new music in high definition audio.  The Society of Sound has recorded over 100 albums of previously unheard music  (as well as many recordings from the archives of the LSO) in the highest possible quality

Shunned by mainstream music players like MTV and castigated in the media, banned from radio airwaves and yanked from the shelves of ‚Äúconventional‚Äù retail outlets, ICP was dealt a hand that seemed destined for swift and certain failure.

UC-GWJZkyivsS-0yMjKMH0AA,Alphaville - Topic,"Alphaville was founded in the spring of 1983 by Marian Gold, Bernhard Lloyd and Frank Mertens. In 1984 they released their first single ""Big In Japan"", followed by ""Sounds Like A Melody"", ""Forever Young"" and the same-named debut album. With the following albums ""Afternoons In Utopia"", ""The Breathtaking Blue"" and ""Prostitute"", Alphaville moved further and further away from the simply structured pop songs of the early days and turned to more complex musical narratives. 
After a three-year break, during which two solo albums of Gold were made (""So Long Celeste"" and ""United""), Alphaville celebrated a comeback in 1997 with their fifth album ‚ÄûSalvation‚Äú  followed by ""Dreamscapes‚Äú in 1999. 

After their world tour in 2000, the concert album, ""Stark Naked And Absolutely Live"" was released.
Between 2000-2002 Alphaville moved their entire production to the internet, this experiment resulted in the album ""CrazyShow"".
In 2009, ""Catching Rays On Giant"" catapulted them back into the European Top 10. In 2019 and 2021, the first three Alphaville albums were re-released as remasters. In early 2020, Alphaville released the so-called ""Corona Songs"" for free: 17 works from remixes, demos and brand new songs.

Today, Alphaville has re-recorded many of their biggest hits together with the Deutsches Filmorchester Babelsberg for the upcoming symphonic album ""Eternally Yours‚Äú which will be released 23rd of September, 2022. 
The recordings for the 11th studio album  ""Thunderbaby"" are in full swing.",164164142,3580,723,0

His career in the music industry began at Sir George Martin‚Äôs iconic Air Studios on Oxford Street where he assisted on a variety of projects including Elvis Costello‚Äôs seminal ‚ÄòShipbuilding‚Äô with the legendary Chet Baker. Following studies at Trinity College of Music, he quickly established himself as an in-demand composer for theatre, film and television.

Commissioned to compose ‚Äòsomething incredible‚Äô to accompany the nightly firework display at Disney World‚Äôs EPCOT, Florida he created the symphonic Reflections of Earth which played there every night for 20 years and went on to win an Emmy¬Æ Award. Greenaway contributed music to numerous movies as well as writing and producing songs with Bryan Adams, Trevor Horn as well as his long term collaboration with Hans Zimmer as studio and live conductor.. 
Incorporating styles from classical to minimalism alongside more filmic influences, Greenaway‚Äôs first solo release ‚ÄòIl Falco Bianco‚Äô was widely acclaimed and saw him make his debut in the classical charts as a composer and pianist. Greenaway‚Äôs second album ‚Äòwoven‚Äô  was released in February 2019 entered the UK classical artist album charts at number 20.",13368150,1620,617,0

‚ÄúThis wasn‚Äôt a record I ever planned on making,‚Äù confesses Elfman. ‚ÄúAt times, I had no idea where the music was even coming from. It was all unexpected. But I decided not to resist it either.‚Äù

Driven by primal forces seemingly beyond his control, Big Mess marks Elfman‚Äôs first solo collection in more than thirty years, but it‚Äôs no return to form. Clocking in at 18 tracks, the sprawling, ambitious double album finds the Grammy and Emmy Award-winning composer breaking bold new ground as both a writer and a performer, drawing on a dystopian palette of distorted electric guitars, industrial synthesizers and orchestra in an effort to exorcise the demons brought about by four years of creeping fascism and civil rot. 

The songs here call to mind everything from Nine Inch Nails, to David Bowie to XTC at times, balancing dense, harmonically complex arrangements with biting, acerbic wit as they reckon with the chaos and confusion of the modern world. Elfman wrote almost all of the record during quarantine, and while the anger, frustration, and isolation of it all is palpable in his delivery, Big Mess is about more than simply blowing off steam. In making the space to truly sit with his emotions and write without limitations, Elfman achieved a kind of artistic liberation on the record that had been eluding him for decades, rediscovering his voice and reinventing himself all at once in the process.",121228864,39100,2325,0

UC16DzwxorG8xZCoaqzaUQSQ,George Benson - Topic,"At a time when most living legends would step back, slow down, and bask in their royalties, there‚Äôs a creative curiosity about George Benson that has kept the veteran jazzman active and forging ahead. ‚ÄòWeekend In London‚Äô, a new live album set for release on May 29th through Provogue Records, brings Benson full circle. The 77-year-old estimates that almost a half-century has passed since he last performed at the fabled Ronnie Scott‚Äôs Jazz Club in London. This live recording, taken from Benson‚Äôs historic return to the Soho club in 2019, is another chapter in the venue‚Äôs prestigious lore. It‚Äôs a rare treat to find this megastar going nose-to- nose with the breathless 250 capacity club, since fans are used to seeing Benson an the big stages that befit his sky-high status. ‚ÄúI like that kind of intimacy,‚Äù says Benson. ‚ÄúI can feel the love when it‚Äôs up close and personal.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt was very crowded,‚Äù he continues. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always happy to be in those surroundings. It was a fantastic night.‚Äù

This hard-bitten jazzman might prefer spontaneity to his set lists, but this latest live album nods to many of his countless career hits. Whether he‚Äôs opening with the deathless groove of ‚ÄúGive Me The Night‚Äù, revisiting fan favorites like ‚ÄúLove X Love‚Äù and ‚ÄúIn Your Eyes‚Äù, or breathing fresh mojo into classic covers like Dave Bartholomew‚Äôs ‚ÄúI Hear You Knocking‚Äù and Donny Hathaway‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Ghetto‚Äù, fans will undoubtedly love every minute of this performance.",244495667,6350,3045,0

Their catalog spans over two decades and spawned a plethora of hits, as well as legendary collaborations for/with other artists like Outkast, UGK, T.I., Eightball & MJG, Project Pat, Lil Jon, Trick Daddy and so many more. The roots of crunk in Generation X have evolved into modern-day music, as Millennial and Gen-Z artists seek out the driving basslines and timeless energy of the genre.

After enjoying over 15 million record sales with Katy Perry's Grammy-nominated ""Dark Horse"", Juicy J's solo collaborations with Travis Scott, Kevin Gates and Lil Skies, and production for the likes of 2Chainz, City Girls, Ty Dolla Sign, Nicki Minaj and Cardi B have made some major noise with fans. Additionally, Juicy has appeared on tracks with the likes of Megan Thee Stallion, Young Dolph and many more. With Gold and Platinum singles under his belt, MTV and American Music Awards on his shelf, and more accolades, Juicy is staying busy in entertainment. 

DJ Paul's work has included production on Drake and Jay-Z's ""Talk Up"" on Drake's award-winning five-times platinum Scorpion album, as well as work with Yelawolf, 2Chainz and Future, French Montana, Lil Jon, ASAP Ferg and grime artist Giggs among others.

Mais quelques ann√©es plus tard, l‚Äôartiste a rapidement impos√© sa patte dans l‚Äôindustrie. C‚Äôest au d√©but des ann√©es 2010 que Niro se d√©marque rapidement gr√¢ce √† un son technique, puissant et d√©complex√©. Dix ans et une dizaine de projets plus tard, l‚Äôartiste continue donc de coupler naturellement pers√©v√©rance et humilit√© avec talent et productivit√©. Le tout, en gardant le m√™me objectif : repousser les limites du rap fran√ßais, et l‚Äôemmener vers des territoires encore inexplor√©s. Pour appr√©cier l‚Äô√©criture coup-de-poing de Niro ainsi que l‚Äôaspect direct et √©corch√© vif de son rap, il n‚Äôy a qu‚Äô√† √©couter Papa fait le pitre. Ce titre in√©dit rappelle que chacune des prises de paroles de Niro est synonyme de masterclass. Relier les √©poques, faire coexister les styles : un pari que Niro est l‚Äôun des rares, pour ne pas dire le seul, √† pouvoir relever. Artiste hors pair, redoutable technicien, le maillon fort du rap fran√ßais r√©ussit √† capter l'attention de l'auditeur d√®s ses premiers mots prononc√©s, en jouant sur son charisme naturel. En attestent ses 2 albums de platine, 3 albums d‚Äôor ainsi que 6 singles or et 2 singles platine. Aujourd‚Äôhui, l‚Äôartiste s‚Äô√©vertue √† nous rappeler ce qui est de plus beau dans la musique : la passion",166353841,37100,403,0

Talenta Yovie terlihat bahkan sejak ia masih sangat kecil. Ketika duduk di SD, Yovie sudah asik bermain piano di salah satu hotel terkenal di Bandung pada saat itu. Ia pun mengisi masa remajanya dengan menulis lagu, membentuk band, serta tampil di banyak event festival, baik nasional sampai internasional.

Karir musik Yovie Widianto melesat setelah KAHITNA sukses merilis album perdana di tahun 1994. Album bertajuk ""Cerita Cinta"" itu mendapat sambutan positif dari penikmat musik tanah air dan menjadikan KAHITNA salah satu top band Indonesia.

Kemampuan Yovie sebagai pencipta dan penulis lagu pun tak perlu diragukan lagi, karya-karyanya senantiasa jadi rebutan para penyanyi karena jaminan hits.

A New York native, Don McLean is one of the most revered and respected songwriters in American history. After paying his dues in the New York club scene in the late ‚Äò60s, he went on to score mega-hits like ‚ÄúVincent (Starry, Starry Night),‚Äù ‚ÄúCastles in the Air‚Äù and many more. His catalog of songs have been recorded by Madonna, Garth Brooks, Josh Groban, Drake, Weird ‚ÄúAl‚Äù Yankovic, and countless others. In 2015, one of McLean‚Äôs four handwritten manuscripts of the lyrics to ‚ÄúAmerican Pie‚Äù was auctioned by Christies, selling for just over $1.2 Million. 2019 honored Don with a star on the Las Vegas Walkway of Stars and his song ‚ÄúAnd I Love You So‚Äù was the theme for Prince Harry and Megan Markle‚Äôs wedding. Now in 2020, Don signed a recording contract with Time Life to release his catalog of recordings as well as the much anticipated new album Still Playin‚Äô Favorites, which will be released in the Fall. ‚ÄúAmerican Pie‚Äù will be featured in the Avengers Black Widow and the Tom Hanks movie BIOS and much more to be announced. 2021 will mark the 50th anniversary of American Pie with a World Tour to follow.

UCnPPs9X57Sl4dNCyIgLigzQ,Don Henley - Topic,"While born in 1947 to music-loving parents, Donald Hugh Henley credits the rise of the Beatles during his teenage years in the 1960s for his serious pursuit of a music career. Don played piano as a child and the trombone briefly in his high school band before becoming a drummer. At age 15, Henley formed a garage band called The Four Speeds with his friends Jerry Surratt and Richard Bowden. No one wanted the lead vocals, and Don only ended up as the singer because they drew names. 

Four Speeds changed its lineup, became known as Felicity and was discovered by Kenny Rogers. While staying at Kenny's house in Los Angeles, Don and Surratt wrote their first hit single called Jennifer . Felicity became known as Shiloh with the addition of Al Perkins, a pedal steel guitar player. While part of this lineup, Henley met Glenn Frey who was a backup for Linda Ronstadt. Don was added to Rondstadt's backup group by association.

After they parted ways with Linda, Don and Glenn formed the Eagles in 1971, along with Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner. The song ‚ÄúWitchy Woman‚Äù was Henley's first hit with the Eagles as a lead vocalist. While the band went through personnel changes, Don racked up four Grammys with the Eagles in the 1970s. In 1980, he had a falling out with one of the most recent members, Don Felder, and the Eagles dissolved.

Henley went on to a successful solo career and released three solo albums in the eighties, which yielded a total of nine hits. In 1990, he became an activist by starting his environmental movement The Walden Woods Project. Indirectly, it led to the reunion of the Eagles in 1994. 

While Don continues touring with the Eagles and also adds new music to his biography, he still upholds his dedication to social causes and fundraisers.",18092524,15000,347,0

OneRepublic, London Grammar, Above & Beyond, Porter Robinson, Years & Years and many more, he has established
himself as one of the music industry's most consistent and sought-after artists. Known for fusing his trademark big room
anthems with downtempo electronica, he routinely showcases his gift for translating club-focused sounds to the pop or
radio format, resulting in continued success on U.S. Dance Radio with tracks such as ‚ÄòSunrise‚Äô (2018), ‚ÄòSave Me Tonight‚Äô
(2019), ‚ÄòCraving‚Äô (with Audien and Ellee Duke, 2020) and ‚ÄòTake Your Time‚Äô (2021).

After hitting #1 on U.S. Dance Radio with his single ‚ÄòSave Me Tonight‚Äô, ARTY decided he wanted to transport fans back to the
2012 glory days of progressive house. ARTY is geared up to release some of his greatest work to date, including his upcoming
sophomore album and his first-ever ALPHA 9 album.

When he‚Äôs not producing music or touring, he spends his downtime obsessing over Formula 1 racing, dominating League of
Legends and FIFA, or sinking into single-player narratives. He is also a fan of the Real Madrid and AC Milan soccer franchises,
and the Washington Capitals hockey team.",9654453,1100,1257,0

Their other hit singles include ‚ÄúMove Your Body‚Äù and ‚ÄúToo Much of Heaven‚Äù, all of which appeared on their album Europop, released in late 1999. The name ‚ÄúEiffel‚Äù was chosen randomly by a computer program and the ‚Äú65‚Äù was scribbled onto their name on a demo by mistake; it was actually part of a phone number. Eiffel 65 achieved considerable success in Italy, the rest of Europe, United States, and Canada. Europop peaked in the top five on the Billboard 200, was at the top of the MuchMusic countdown, and sold over two million units. ‚ÄúBlue (Da Ba Dee)‚Äù peaked at #6 on the Billboard charts.",105270492,5550,166,0

Vengaboys‚Äô debut album (aptly titled ‚ÄúGreatest Hits!‚Äù) soon reached gold status in the U.S. That same year the Vengaboys got nominated for MTV Best Breakthrough Award. 

Multi-platinum pop-dance hits like We Like To Party!, Boom Boom Boom Boom!! and We‚Äôre going to Ibiza! were unleashed on an unsuspecting audience.

Welcome to my channel! I started remixing songs just for the fun of it and when YouTube came along, I jumped on board in 2005. Copyright strikes killed the channel three times since then, so I quit YT in 2009 and then rejoined in 2013 and this time it seems like smooth sailing!  I like to take the single versions of disco/pop songs and stretch them out to make extended versions of them. 

Also, I make no money off of any uploads here, I remix for the simple love of music. If you feel generous,  a couple of bucks in the tip jar would really help. 

Please do not ask for copies of songs, I do not want to infringe on the copyright holders rights as I could be dragged into court for giving even one song away and then my name would really be mud and I could be held liable financially.

While studying at New York University Tisch School of the Arts, Gala wandered the NYC underground photographing, musicians, dancers, artists and eccentric club-goers. Ultimately, her camera was the key to her success. In exchange for a photo of a European deejay she recorded her first demo. In no time, with no formal training, no industry connections, but huge amounts of attitude and determination, Gala became a dance floor icon.
Mailed overseas on a cassette tape, ‚ÄúFreed from Desire‚Äù became an international pop classic. With over 6 million records sold worldwide, Gala is an artist who needs no introduction. Having exploded the world over with her phenomenal debut album Come Into My Life, she claimed three Top 3 singles worldwide.

While her debut album ‚ÄòCome Into My Life‚Äô, including the evergreen anthem ‚ÄòFreed From Desire‚Äô, was claiming 4 Top 10 singles in the charts, Gala broke free from a stifling record deal, formed her own Brooklyn label, and has been independent ever since. ",57114942,40100,95,0

Rolf  Zuckowski,  geboren  1947  in Hamburg, studierte Betriebswirtschaft. Seine Musikerlaufbahn begann er mit Rock-Songs, sp√§ter verfasste er Lieder f√ºr bekannte Pop- und Schlagerinterpreten. 1977 entstand das Singspiel ‚ÄûRolfs Vogelhochzeit‚Äú, das wie ‚ÄûRolfs neue Schulweg-Hitparade‚Äú zu seinen bekanntesten Kompositionen z√§hlt. Viele seine Lieder gelten heute als neue Volkslieder, darunter ""Wie sch√∂n, dass du geboren bist"", ""In der Weihnachtsb√§ckerei"" und ""Stups, der kleine Osterhase"".
Seit 1985 ver√∂ffentlichte Rolf Zuckowski regelm√§√üig Alben f√ºr Erwachsene. 2004 rief er seine eigene Stiftung zur F√∂rderung einer aktiven musikalischen Kindheit  ‚ÄûKinder brauchen Musik‚Äú ins Leben. Heute wird er als Komponist, Texter und S√§nger f√ºr drei Generationen wahrgenommen.
Auf seinem Youtube-Kanal pr√§sentiert Rolf Zuckowski Lieder f√ºr Kleine und Gro√üe aus fast vier Jahrzehnten.

Since forming in 1994, the six East Berliners have headlined the world‚Äôs major festivals and stadiums, selling millions of albums, and topping charts worldwide.
For the Rammstein¬†kollektiv, and it‚Äôs the same line-up now as at the start, it‚Äôs always been a case of marching to their own beat; they sing in German, side-step those visuals typical of the metal world, and present an incendiary live experience that touches all of the senses ‚Äì an experience underpinned by cultural and artistic weight.
To date, there are seven studio albums under the Rammstein banner, the most recent being 2019‚Äôs untitled release ‚Äì a body of work that headed the charts in 14 countries and went Top 10 in the US, breaking new ground. Produced by the band with Olsen Involtini, this 11-tracker (double platinum in Germany) was preceded by lead single ‚ÄòDeutschland‚Äô, a domestic No. 1 supported by a nine-minute movie ‚Äì an epic, unflinching look at German history directed by Specter Berlin.
Not only was this album a decade in the making, it also saw the musicians taking their legendary live show into Stadiums, selling 800,000 tickets immediately and eventually playing to over 1.2 million fans across 17 countries.
The next leg of the European Stadium Tour takes place in spring / summer 2021, with most venues sold out.
